# Nitro Legacy UI

Front-end inventory showcase inspired by the MGX preview from the Nitro Legacy concept. The layout surfaces the weapon and gear list grouped by archetype and highlights the sprite sheet preview provided in the reference images.

Add the real pixel sprite sheet to `uploads/image.png` and update the inventory descriptions if you need accurate item names.
